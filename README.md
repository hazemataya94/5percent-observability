# 5percent Observability Lab

## Purpose
This project is a local observability lab for a 5percent volunteering session.
It creates a `kind` cluster, installs `kube-prometheus-stack`, deploys a small metrics-producing app, and shows how Prometheus and Grafana observe that app.

## How To Navigate This Repository
Use the documentation in this order:

1. Start with [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) to understand the lab components, boundaries, and runtime flow.
2. Follow [`docs/fundamentals/README.md`](docs/fundamentals/README.md) for the ordered theoretical learning path from observability basics through system design.
3. Run [`docs/runbooks/core-observability-lab.md`](docs/runbooks/core-observability-lab.md) as the canonical metrics demo.
4. Use [`docs/runbooks/README.md`](docs/runbooks/README.md) to find prerequisite guidance and the optional alerting and logging labs.
5. Read [`docs/appendices/`](docs/appendices/) for deeper explanations of Alertmanager and Loki after the core path.

The theory files explain concepts and link to specific practical checkpoints.
The runbooks own commands, expected outcomes, validation, troubleshooting, and cleanup.
Use [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) as the complete documentation index.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop or another local Docker runtime.
- `kind`.
- `kubectl`.
- `helmfile`.
- `helm`.
- `make`.

## Quick Start
Run all commands from this directory.

```bash
make check-prereqs
make kind-up
make monitoring-up
make app-up
make dashboard-up
make grafana-port-forward
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with `admin` / `admin`.
This credential is only for the local `kind` lab.

Generate sample traffic in another terminal.

```bash
kubectl --context kind-fivepercent-observability -n fivepercent-observability port-forward svc/sample-metrics-app 8080:80
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/work
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

## Core Learning Flow
1. Start a local cluster with `kind`.
2. Install Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager through `kube-prometheus-stack`.
3. Deploy a sample app that exposes Prometheus metrics.
4. Use a `ServiceMonitor` to tell Prometheus how to scrape the app.
5. Load a Grafana dashboard through the dashboard sidecar.
6. Derive a conceptual SLI and SLO from the available metrics.
7. Optionally add alerting rules or inspect the logging extension.

## Optional Appendices
- [`docs/appendices/logging-with-loki.md`](docs/appendices/logging-with-loki.md) explains Loki and the lab's intentionally incomplete log-ingestion path.
- [`docs/appendices/alerting-with-alertmanager.md`](docs/appendices/alerting-with-alertmanager.md) explains how Prometheus rules reach Alertmanager.

## Cleanup
Remove the lab cluster when the session is done.

```bash
make clean
```

## Reference Pattern
This lab follows the structure used by `hape-framework/demos/eks-deployment-cost`: `kind` for local Kubernetes, Helmfile for platform components, Kustomize for workloads, and Make targets for reproducible steps.
